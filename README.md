# Finally Project for DATA522

- This project is aimed to evaluate the efficiency of the green infrastructures on urban runoff retention of Chicago.

- The dataset provides historic storm water runoff data, including location, soil moisture, rainfall, etc. All the data are collected from a real green infrastructure, i.e. Bioswales. Theoretically, the performance of the green infrastructures can be evaluated by the correlation between the moisture at the Bioswales and the environmental characteristics, such as evaporation and precipitation over time.
